It does this by using a stack to keep track of the operators and their precedence. The function first splits the input expression into a list of tokens, and then iterates through the tokens, processing each one as follows:\n\n* If the token is an operand (either a letter or a number), it is added to the postfix list.\n* If the token is an opening parenthesis, it is pushed onto the stack.\n* If the token is a closing parenthesis, it is popped from the stack and added to the postfix list until the opening parenthesis is reached.\n* If the token is an operator, it is compared to the top operator on the stack. If the precedence of the operator is greater than or equal to the precedence of the top operator, it is popped from the stack and added to the postfix list.\n\nOnce the input expression has been fully processed, any remaining operators on the stack are popped and added to the postfix list.

These errors can make the code difficult to read and understand, and can lead to unexpected behavior.\n2. Precedence table:\n\t* The student's code defines a precedence table, but it is not used correctly. The table is defined as a dictionary with the operators as keys and their precedence as values. However, the code does not use this table to determine the precedence of the operators. Instead, it uses a hard-coded approach to determine the precedence of the operators.\n3. Operator stack:\n\t* The student's code uses a stack to keep track of the operators and their precedence. However, the stack is not properly initialized. The `opStack` variable is defined as a `Stack` object, but it is not initialized with any values. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the stack is used.\n4. Postfix list:\n\t* The student's code uses a list to store the postfix expression. However, the list is not properly initialized. The `postfixList` variable is defined as an empty list, but it is not initialized with any values. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the list is used.\n5. Token list:\n\t* The student's code uses a list to store the tokens of the infix expression. However, the list is not properly initialized. The `tokenList` variable is defined as an empty list, but it is not initialized with any values. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the list is used.\n\nOverall, the student's code has several errors that need to be addressed to make it work correctly. The code can be improved by fixing the syntax errors, using the precedence table correctly, initializing the operator stack and postfix list properly, and properly initializing the token list.\n\nBased on the errors in the student's code, I would give them a score of 20 out of 100.
